                    <p class="card-text">Throughout its long history, still life has taken many forms, from the decorative frescoes 
                        of antiquity to the high art of the Renaissance. Traditionally, 
                        a still life is a collection of inanimate objects arranged as the subject of a composition. Nowadays, 
                        a still life can be anything from your latest Instagram latte art to 
                        a vase of tulips styled like a Dutch Golden Age painting.

                    <p class="card-text">When I think about what editorial photography means to me, 
                        I think storytelling. I find the best photographers to be the most compelling storytellers. 
                        A great single image can tell a story, but a powerful editorial spread tells an entire narrative. 
                        As an editorial photographer in Charleston SC and Northern Michigan, 
                        I tell stories through creative portraiture.

                    <p class="card-text">My work as a conceptual and fine art portrait artist is where I push my own 
                        personal boundaries. It's a demolition of my own comfort zone. It's my opportunity to create 
                        something with no agenda, other than to produce a portrait that challenges your perception of 
                        beauty. It's a photograph that makes you pause and think. A portrait doesn't have to be conceptual to be art. 
                        I think there is art in classical technique and timeless beauty.
